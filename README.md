# Computational_Intelligence_AUTH_2022

This is the assigment for the Computational Intelligence Lecture in **MSc for Advanced Computer and Telecommunications Systems**.

Target of the assigment is to classify traffic signs from 20 different classes. I used an already designed Inception Resnet V2 as well as one of my own design, achieving **98.63%** and **86,30%** respectively.
